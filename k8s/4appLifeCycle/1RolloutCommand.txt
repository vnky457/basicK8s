## we have two deployment strategy 
1. Recreate  -> it's not default deployment strategy 
    It will delete the existing deployment or pods and create new deployment 
    We get application downtime if we use this
2. RollingUpdate
    It will delete one pod and create new pod -, one pod at a time. 


kubectl apply -f deployment-definition.yaml
# it will do the RollingUpdate

kubectl rollout undo deployment/deployment_name 
# it'll rollback to previous deployment
